The project is all about the algorithm(merge_sort,insertion_sort,quick_sort).

In simple words,

Create a ".txt" file with a random integer and, sort this ".txt" file using three different algorithms and check time complexity. At last, find which algorithm perform best in every condition.


## Python Library

To run this project required some python library,

`numpy - pip install numpy`

`time - pip install time`


## Deployment

To deploy this project or To run this project

```bash
1. extract(open) this zip file
2. open the project folder in pycharm/vs_code_editer and check the dependency
3. at last, run all three ".py" files.
```

## Optimizations

we can do more optimization and understand using adding an extra ".py" file for a major operation.

## Lessons Learned

in this project we learned sorting algorithms (merge, quick, insertion) and time complexity.
